The ZSH pre-configured config for Begineers.

What is tyrtle? :
Tyrtle is a pre-configured but some-what minimal shell for zsh begineers to use to make the zsh world a lot more welcoming!

Why is it named tyrtle? :
Tyrtle is a remix of the word turtle and turtle is a new pet i got!

How do i download this tyrtle thing?

First you need to add source source ~/tyrtle.zsh to your .zshrc config file.
And second add a file named tyrtle.zsh, You can copy it from here by finding the tyrtle.zsh file.

Dependencies it needs to work.
1. zsh (duh.)
2. zsh-syntax-highlighting
3. fzf (For the codepeek)
4. nvim (Also for the codepeek)
5. Bat or cat (bat is better in my opinion to make more sense)
6. git (i dont know HOW you are gonna install it via git but yeah.)
