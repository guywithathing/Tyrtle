# Tyrtle


A pre-configured Zsh config for beginners.

## What is Tyrtle?
Tyrtle is a pre-configured yet minimal shell setup designed to make Zsh more welcoming for beginners.

## Why is it named Tyrtle?
Tyrtle is a playful remix of the word "turtle." It's also named after my new pet turtle, koopa! (thanks for diogo for naming my boy koopa :D )
